# [Weather Party](weather-party.herokuapp.com)

Weather Party is a Single Page Application that I built to become better at working with APIs and CSS. This app was built using React and interacts with an API pulled from www.openweathermap.org to provide up to date weather for the entered US zipcode. I strove to create a simple design, and made the background image dynamic to reflect the current weather conditions.

### Tools Used
<b>Built with:</b>
- [React v16.7.0](https://reactjs.org/)
- [OpenWeatherMap API](https://api.openweathermap.org/data/2.5/weather?zip=94040,us)
- [Heroku](https://www.heroku.com/)

### User Story

Users can navigate to the index page where they are able to click in the input field and enter a five digit US zipcode, then click on the 'Get Weather' button. The following information will then be shown in the body of the page: City, Conditions, Temperature and Humidity. The background will also change to reflect the current conditions.

### Installation

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

After downloading this project to your local machine, in the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br>
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br>
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.<br>
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br>
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.<br>
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (Webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.
